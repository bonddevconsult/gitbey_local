# Project Name: GitBey

## 1. Product Overview

**Core Value Proposition**:
GitBey is a unique mobile app that bridges the gap between developer culture and pop music.

**Target Audience**:

- Developers and GitHub users, ranging from students to professionals.
- Music enthusiasts within the tech community.
- Social media users who enjoy sharing unique, personality-driven content.
