# Functional Spec: GitBey Feature Implementation

## Objective
Implement a feature for GitBey based on the provided idea, following the functional and technical specifications outlined in `docs/idea.md`.

## Step 1: GitHub Handle Input
- **Objective:** Allow users to input their GitHub handle and fetch their last 50 commits.
- **Steps:**
  - Create a form in the UI for GitHub handle input.
  - Validate the input to ensure it is a valid GitHub username.
  - Use the GitHub API to fetch the last 50 commits.
  - Handle errors such as invalid usernames or API rate limits.
- **Pseudocode:**
  ```
  function fetchCommits(githubHandle) {
      if (!validateHandle(githubHandle)) {
          showError("Invalid GitHub handle");
          return;
      }
      api.get(`/users/${githubHandle}/events/public?per_page=50`)
         .then(processCommits)
         .catch(handleError);
  }
  ```
- **User Intervention:**
  - Ensure the GitHub API token is configured in the `.env` file.

## Step 2: Commit Analysis
- **Objective:** Analyze commit messages to determine the mood.
- **Steps:**
  - Preprocess commit messages (e.g., remove special characters).
  - Use sentiment analysis algorithms to classify moods (e.g., happy, frustrated, productive).
  - Assign a sentiment score to each commit.
- **Pseudocode:**
  ```
  function analyzeCommits(commits) {
      return commits.map(commit => {
          const mood = sentimentAnalysis(commit.message);
          return { ...commit, mood };
      });
  }
  ```
- **User Intervention:**
  - Provide feedback on mood classification accuracy.

## Step 3: Playlist Generation
- **Objective:** Generate a playlist of 5 Beyoncé songs based on commit moods.
- **Steps:**
  - Map mood scores to song categories.
  - Use a predefined list of Beyoncé songs for each mood category.
  - Randomly select 5 songs from the relevant categories.
- **Pseudocode:**
  ```
  function generatePlaylist(moods) {
      const songCategories = {
          happy: ["Song1", "Song2"],
          frustrated: ["Song3", "Song4"],
          productive: ["Song5", "Song6"]
      };
      return moods.map(mood => randomPick(songCategories[mood]));
  }
  ```
- **User Intervention:**
  - Review the playlist for relevance.

## Step 4: Music Playback
- **Objective:** Enable users to play songs within the app.
- **Steps:**
  - Integrate with a music streaming API (e.g., Spotify).
  - Implement basic playback controls (play, pause, skip).
  - Display the playlist in the UI with playback options.
- **Pseudocode:**
  ```
  function playSong(songId) {
      musicApi.play(songId);
  }
  ```
- **User Intervention:**
  - Configure API keys for the music streaming service.

## Step 5: User Interface
- **Objective:** Create an intuitive UI for the feature.
- **Steps:**
  - Design screens for GitHub handle input, commit analysis results, and playlist display.
  - Ensure the UI is responsive and visually appealing.
- **Pseudocode:**
  ```
  renderUI({ inputForm, analysisResults, playlistDisplay });
  ```
- **User Intervention:**
  - Provide feedback on UI design and usability.

This functional spec outlines the steps required to implement the feature, keeping the design simple and focused on delivering the core functionality. Further iterations can refine the implementation based on user feedback.
