# Functional Spec for Step 4: Music Playback

## Objective
Enable in-app playback of recommended songs.

## Steps to Achieve Objective

### Step 1: Integrate with a Music API
- **Description**: Use a music API (e.g., Spotify) to fetch and play songs.
- **Implementation**:
  1. Register the app with the Spotify Developer Dashboard to obtain client credentials.
  2. Add the Spotify SDK or API client library to the project dependencies.
  3. Authenticate the user using OAuth 2.0 to access Spotify resources.
  4. Fetch song metadata using the Spotify API based on the recommended songs.

**Pseudocode**:
```dart
final spotifyClient = SpotifyClient(clientId, clientSecret);
await spotifyClient.authenticate();
final trackUri = spotifyClient.fetchTrackUri('Halo');
```

### Step 2: Implement Playback Controls
- **Description**: Add controls for play, pause, and stop functionality.
- **Implementation**:
  1. Create a `MusicPlayer` widget to manage playback.
  2. Use the Spotify API or SDK to control playback.
  3. Update the UI to reflect the current playback state (e.g., playing, paused).

**Pseudocode**:
```dart
MusicPlayer(
  trackUri: 'spotify:track:12345',
  onPlay: () => playTrack(),
  onPause: () => pauseTrack(),
);
```

### Step 3: Handle API Authentication and Permissions
- **Description**: Ensure the app handles authentication and permissions securely.
- **Implementation**:
  1. Use secure storage to save access tokens.
  2. Refresh tokens periodically to maintain session validity.
  3. Display error messages for authentication failures.

**Pseudocode**:
```dart
try {
  final token = await authenticateUser();
  saveTokenSecurely(token);
} catch (e) {
  showError('Authentication failed: $e');
}
```

## Necessary User Intervention
- Users must log in to their Spotify account to grant the app access.
- Users must approve permissions for playback and song metadata access.
