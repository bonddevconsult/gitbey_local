# Implementation Plan for GitBey

## Objective
To implement the GitBey app as described in the PRD, focusing on delivering the MVP scope to validate the idea and gather user feedback.

---

## Step 1: User Input
**Objective**: Allow users to input their GitHub handle.

**Steps**:
1. Create a text input field in the Flutter app's UI.
2. Validate the input to ensure it is not empty.
3. Provide feedback for invalid inputs (e.g., empty or malformed GitHub handles).

**Pseudocode**:
```dart
TextField(
  controller: _githubHandleController,
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    labelText: 'Enter GitHub Handle',
    errorText: _isValid ? null : 'Invalid handle',
  ),
);
```

---

## Step 2: Commit Data Analysis
**Objective**: Fetch the last 50 commits and analyze their sentiment.

**Steps**:
1. Use the GitHub API to fetch public events for the entered handle.
2. Filter events to extract commit messages.
3. Perform sentiment analysis on the commit messages.

**Pseudocode**:
```dart
final response = await http.get(
  Uri.parse('https://api.github.com/users/$handle/events/public?per_page=100'),
  headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer $token'},
);
if (response.statusCode == 200) {
  final commits = parseCommits(response.body);
  final sentiments = analyzeSentiments(commits);
}
```

---

## Step 3: Song Recommendation
**Objective**: Map the analyzed vibe to 5 Beyonc√© songs.

**Steps**:
1. Define a mapping between sentiment scores and song metadata.
2. Select 5 songs based on the sentiment analysis results.
3. Display the curated playlist in the UI.

**Pseudocode**:
```dart
List<String> recommendSongs(List<Sentiment> sentiments) {
  // Logic to map sentiments to songs
  return ['Song1', 'Song2', 'Song3', 'Song4', 'Song5'];
}
```

---

## Step 4: Music Playback
**Objective**: Enable in-app playback of recommended songs.

**Steps**:
1. Integrate with a music API (e.g., Spotify).
2. Implement playback controls (play, pause, stop).
3. Handle API authentication and permissions.

**Pseudocode**:
```dart
SpotifyPlayer(
  trackUri: 'spotify:track:12345',
  onPlay: () => playTrack(),
  onPause: () => pauseTrack(),
);
```

---

## Step 5: Error Handling
**Objective**: Handle errors gracefully.

**Steps**:
1. Display user-friendly error messages for invalid GitHub handles.
2. Handle API rate limits and network issues.
3. Log errors for debugging purposes.

**Pseudocode**:
```dart
try {
  final response = await fetchCommits(handle);
} catch (e) {
  showError('Failed to fetch commits: $e');
}
```

---

## Step 6: Testing and Validation
**Objective**: Ensure the app functions as expected.

**Steps**:
1. Test each feature individually (unit testing).
2. Perform integration testing to validate end-to-end functionality.
3. Gather user feedback to identify areas for improvement.

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for building the GitBey app, focusing on simplicity and delivering the MVP scope efficiently.
