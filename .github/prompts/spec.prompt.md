description: 'Plan a feature'
---

Your goal is to generate a functional spec for implementing each feature in the implementation plan provided in "../../docs/implementation-plan".

Before generating a spec, be sure to review the file in "../../docs/prd.md" file to understand an overview of the project.

RULES:
- Keep implementations simple, do not over architect
- Do not generate real code for your plan, pseudocode is OK
- Each step in the implementation plan should be broken down into a spec document
- For each step in your plan, include the objective of the step, the steps to achieve that objective, and any necessary pseudocode.
- Call out any necessary user intervention required for each step

Output your plan in #folder:/docs/specs/feature-name.md
