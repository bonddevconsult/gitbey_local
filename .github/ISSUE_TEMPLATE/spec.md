# Project Name: GitBey

## 1. Product Overview

### Core Value Proposition
GitBey is a mobile app that combines the worlds of software development and music. By analyzing a user's GitHub commit history, the app generates a personalized playlist of Beyoncé songs that match the "vibe" of their last 50 commits. Users can play these songs directly within the app, creating a unique and entertaining way to reflect on their coding activity.
